PTEXT	I'm sure they are paying attention, but I'm not ready to count either of
PTEXT	them among long-term surviors just yet.
PTEXT	According to this months Air Transport World, Frontier's November load
PTEXT	factor was in the mid 30's.  Granted they are still rather new, but that's
PTEXT	clearly far below breakeven for a 737.  If they keep adding new cities month
PTEXT	after month without making sure that the old ones are profitable, pretty
PTEXT	soon they won't serve any cities.
PTEXT	As for Western Pacific, I'm very, very skeptical about a Colorado Springs
PTEXT	hub.  Airports serving areas with two and three times the customer base that
PTEXT	COS has have failed to support real hubs.  If they are depending on lots of
PTEXT	connecting traffic, they should take a lesson from what happened in Kansas
PTEXT	City, Raleigh, Dayton, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Dulles and several other
PTEXT	places.  WestPac hopes to draw lots of traffic from Denver, but that's much
PTEXT	easier said than done.  There's no real precendence of this ever happening
PTEXT	before.  Some will surely make the drive from Denver to COS, but will it be
PTEXT	anywhere near enough to support an airline hub??  Finally, WestPac's short
PTEXT	list of near-term expansion includes such bustling routes as COS-Omaha and
PTEXT	COS-Oklahoma City.  NOW I know what happened to the genius route planners
PTEXT	that CALite canned.
PTEXT	Lastly a discouraging bit of anecdotal WestPac information.  A close friend
PTEXT	in San Francisco saw a WestPac ad which mentioned some great intorductary
PTEXT	fares on routes which included SFO-COS-Kansas City.  When my friend
PTEXT	*finally* got through to an agent, she said they didn't serve those cities.
PTEXT	My friend mentioned the SFO ad, and she then noted that SFO service was to
PTEXT	begin on 5/8.  Too bad...the ad said the introductary fares were only good
PTEXT	4/30 through 5/7.  Hmmmm...is this yet another start-up airline which is
PTEXT	more concerned about finding young, enthusiastic things that will smile for
PTEXT	$5/hour than, say, uhh, TRAINING?  At a copmany that small the agents should
PTEXT	have the flight times memorized!  I should call myself and quiz them on what
PTEXT	state Colorado Springs is located in.

PTEXT	okay, okay, sorry for the cheap shots

PTEXT	Upgrade CVG to a Whopper Hub.  DL and OH (Comair/Delta Connection) are the
PTEXT	two largest airlines at CVG; DL's operations there are now larger than
PTEXT	either their DFW or SLC hubs.  CVG is even closing in on ATL in some ways,
PTEXT	with the expansion DL and OH have done.  (OH has their own 50+ gate
PTEXT	concourse, complete with a duty-free kiosk for their CRJ flights to
PTEXT	Canada.)  DL ads are now touting CVG as the "O'Hare Bypass", with better
PTEXT	weather, easier connections, and so forth.  (Interesting similarities here
PTEXT	to Western's old ads touting SLC as a better alternative to DEN, before
PTEXT	the merger.)
PTEXT	SLC is also gaining flights, mostly on SkyWest, another Delta Connection
PTEXT	carrier; both ComAir and SkyWest are flying larger and larger CRJ fleets,
PTEXT	picking up "thin" city routes from the hubs at SLC, CVG, and MCO (which is
PTEXT	getting several of Comair's CRJs).  The SkyWest concourse at SLC was also
PTEXT	recently expanded and renovated; though it's quite a bit smaller than OH's
PTEXT	Concourse C at CVG, it still has room for 16 or so gates.
PTEXT	MCO is a minor hub not just from WDW traffic, but also because of the
PTEXT	substantial (and growing) Comair presence there.
PTEXT	BOS should probably be added as a Vestigial Hub; DL does have a fairly
PTEXT	solid presence here, including one of the two Business Express (Delta
PTEXT	Connection *and* Northwest Airlink, now) hubs (JFK is the other) as well
PTEXT	as code-shared flights on SN to Brussels and VS to London-Gatwick.
PTEXT	Add PDX and LAX to the Vestigial Hubs list for their role in gatewaying
PTEXT	Pacific Rim traffic (and the SkyWest hub at LAX, for those of you who just
PTEXT	*love* EM2s).  They're probably at about the same level as JFK.
QUOTED	 KC> NW          MSP, DTW                          NRT (Tokyo) MEM
PTEXT	I'd add BOS as a "bygone" Vestigial Hub, and add SEA which still had a
PTEXT	fairly hefty presence last I checked.  MEM probably could go to Minor Hub.
PTEXT	Other "bygones" could include MKE... I never did figure out why they were
PTEXT	trying to add another hub in the northern tier.
QUOTED	 KC> US          PIT,             CLT,             PHL, DCA, LGA, BWI, IND
PTEXT	BOS probably qualifies as at least a vestigial hub for US, who at times
PTEXT	seem to have made a vestigial hub out of every city in the northeast US
PTEXT	with a sizable airport.  (They're reportedly the passenger carrier with
PTEXT	the most flights per day from BOS.)

PTEXT	There is no such thing as a 777-100; United is due to take delivery of
PTEXT	their first 777-200 (a -222, to be precise) on May 15th.
QUOTED	>Is is due to fly out of SFO?
PTEXT	The delivery flight will be from the Seattle area (either Boeing Field,
PTEXT	more properly King County, um, International(?), where Boeing's delivery
PTEXT	center is located, or Paine Field up in Everett, site of the wide-body
PTEXT	factory) to SFO.  Initial service has been discussed at length over in
PTEXT	rec.travel.air, but the bottom line is that the first two flights will
PTEXT	be on June 7th, UA 921 LHR-IAD followed shortly thereafter by UA 910
PTEXT	DEN-ORD-IAD-LHR.  The next morning FRA will see its first 777 service
PTEXT	with the arrival of a flight from IRD.  I believe CDG and JFK and/or
PTEXT	EWR will see UA 777 service after additional deliveries this summer; I
PTEXT	haven't seen any mention of scheduled 777 operations at SFO soon.
QUOTED	>Will there be an ER version (like 767-200-ER), or is it already
QUOTED	>classified for over-water transport?
PTEXT	Boeing hopes to deliver the 777 with 180-minute ETOPS rating.  United
PTEXT	really needs at least 120-minute ETOPS to make it practical for the
PTEXT	trans-Atlantic flights, though it's possible to do it without ETOPS.
PTEXT	The current 777 is a bit tight on range for the longer overwater
PTEXT	routes, though, with around 5,000 miles as the limit.  The "B-market"
PTEXT	777 will appear next year with considerably greater range, probably
PTEXT	close to that of the 747-400 from what I've seen.
QUOTED	>IS it true the new super-jumbo jet from Boeing will be an extended,
QUOTED	>double-decker version of the 777 and not the 747-400?
PTEXT	No.  The 777 is already pushing engine technologies.  If the "super-
PTEXT	jumbo" is a derivative, it will be based on the 747-400.  Perhaps you
PTEXT	are thinking of the ideas for a totally new aircraft which would use
PTEXT	the 777's engines, albeit four of them.  For comparison, here are the
PTEXT	rough MGTOW in lbs of these aircraft:
TABLE	    777 (A-market, base)	  505,000
TABLE	    777 (A-market, United)	  525,000
TABLE	    777 (B-market)		  625,000
TABLE	    747-400			  875,000
TABLE	    747-400F			  890,000
TABLE	    "new large airplane"	  900,000
PTEXT	At twice the weight of even a B-market 777, the NLA clearly needs a
PTEXT	lot more power than a twin is going to be capable of for a long time.

PTEXT	HNL seems to have been under construction now for well over 10 years.
PTEXT	What we jokingly called the "dignified welfare project" seems to be
PTEXT	true: when the original contractor won the bid, the project was
PTEXT	supposed to be small and self-contained. Over the years, the SAME
PTEXT	contractor continued to ask for "extensions" on the original contract.
PTEXT	Basically, we started with a palm-lined, single-tower airport to a
PTEXT	"modernized" airport (Smart Carte and all) that is always under
PTEXT	renovation.
PTEXT	The worst joke of all was the whole inter-island terminal fiasco.
PTEXT	Aloha & Hawaiian used to have a separate area--and when a third
PTEXT	carrier (oooh, was it Mid-Pac? They so come and go) wanted to share
PTEXT	the space, it got the big cold shoulder. So it managed to get counter
PTEXT	space at the main terminal--and all of a sudden a lot of people
PTEXT	decided that was a good idea (no need to wait for the Wikiwiki
PTEXT	Shuttle). That irked Aloha & Haw'n to no end...and after a lot of
PTEXT	wrangling and shuffling, Haw'n built its own one-story terminal near
PTEXT	Nimitz Highway. Aloha didn't like that--so they prompted an entire
PTEXT	renovation of its old terminal. Now, we have a huge, ugly parking
PTEXT	edifice (for inter-island all-day parkers, I guess) for Aloha--and
PTEXT	Haw'n operates out of it too (don't ask what happened to its old "new"
PTEXT	terminal--I think it got hand-me-downed to the smaller
PTEXT	island-hoppers).
PTEXT	To make a long story short (and to bring this to the original thread),
PTEXT	a recent state audit finally revealed what a sweet-heart deal the
PTEXT	original contractor had gotten itself for the last decade. Of course,
PTEXT	being that this is Hawaii, I wouldn't be surprised if the contractor
PTEXT	continues to "upgrade and renovate" HNL for another 10 years on the
PTEXT	same original contract it got the bid for back in the early '80s.

PTEXT	at SLC doesn't mean that there is enough demand for an air route to

PTEXT	reliability/ maintenance costs.  At the same time, a new 100-120 seat
PTEXT	airplane (read: 737, MD-80, or 320 series) costed around $30,000,000
PTEXT	(last time I checked - around 1991) and the cost of hush-kitting an
PTEXT	older airplane like a 727 or DC-9 costs around $3,000,000 (again,
PTEXT	these figures were approximate in 1991).  Thus, the increased fuel
PTEXT	efficiency and reduced reliability/maintenance costs are *dwarfed* by
PTEXT	the ~$25,000,000 savings of using hush kits over new aircraft.  When I
PTEXT	worked at Northwest, there was a study floating around that made the
PTEXT	calculations and showed the savings to keep the old aircraft flying.
PTEXT	I wish I had a copy of this.
PTEXT	As the original poster noted, this savings is especially true for the
PTEXT	DC-9s which tend to age better than the B-727 or B-737.  This explains
PTEXT	why Northwest and Valujet are holding onto a fleet of old DC-9s.  (As
PTEXT	someone noted to me in a private email, Valujet's fleet is
PTEXT	*exclusively* a DC-9 fleet).

PTEXT	Well, to be truthful, adenoids ARE your tonsils.  Or, to be more
PTEXT	specific, are tonsilar tissue in your nasopharynx, as opposed to your
PTEXT	oropharynx.  But, I still agree that I wouldn't want a 777 in my nose
PTEXT	flying at 10,000 feet.
PTEXT	Next question.  Who is paying for all of these flights?  And who is
PTEXT	flying the planes?  UA pilots who are going to be using them, or Boeing emps?
PTEXT	And onto the CRJ.  And this is a tad out of the scope of this newsgroup,
PTEXT	I admit....  But I was at the (shocker) airport last night, and saw a CRJ
PTEXT	take off.  From PIT.  Anyway, it left on a left parallel runway, and made
PTEXT	what is probabally a standard 5 degree left turn soon after take off, but
PTEXT	then was pretty much straight.  To get to the point, the plane just left
PTEXT	its gear down for a VERY long time... like until I could barely make out
PTEXT	its outline.  What's the deal?  Were the pilots just asleep or is this
PTEXT	standard?  And also, what's the deal with winglets?  Boeing nixed them on
PTEXT	the 777 saying they were not fuel cost effective --the weight of adding
PTEXT	additional pylons for their installation were offset by any aerodynamic
PTEXT	benefits from having less powerful wing vortecies (sp).  So, why is the
PTEXT	CRJ built this way?  Why was it cost-effective for them?

PTEXT	On the subject of CO DEN-LGW.  The route is alive for the time being,
PTEXT	although not for long, as you will notice that it is an aircraft and crew
PTEXT	scheduling nightmare; the aircraft must be ferried in and out of DEN.
PTEXT	This is a route that SHOULD have been enormously successful for CO.
PTEXT	London is Denver's largest international destination, and from a
PTEXT	convenience standpoint, virtually all London traffic should have preferred
PTEXT	CO34 to any other carrier's connect service.  Additionally, CO SHOULD have
PTEXT	been able to sell out their superior BusinessFirst seats on the route
PTEXT	daily.  Any executive bound for London would have been crazy to fly in
PTEXT	conventional J class via ORD or DFW just to support his mileage account.
PTEXT	The biggest problem with the route was CO's failure to market it.  Very
PTEXT	few people in the Denver area even knew about the service.  CO had a sales
PTEXT	staff of 8 for the entire region (I assume that UA had in excess of 50)
PTEXT	and therefore was unable to get the word out to the community's travel
PTEXT	agents.  Typically, the flight was filled with group traffic...very low
PTEXT	yield.  I doubt that the flight will last beyond the summer schedule, and,
PTEXT	I disagree with Robert Gordon; look for United to want it LHR or not.

PTEXT	That's still a heck of a lot of markets.  Imagine some Southwest style

PTEXT	Also, at what level of fares?  Southwest levels or United levels?

PTEXT	As WN grows, more connections become possible and so they will clearly
PTEXT	be picking up connecting/one-stop traffic.  But I find it hard to believe
PTEXT	that the traditionals are only now waking up to the fact that they
PTEXT	compete with WN on these routes.
PTEXT	Incidently, how does this mesh (if it does at all) with the following
PTEXT	fact:  In its latest schedule, WN has a plethora (maybe 10 or more) of
PTEXT	one-stops from Chicago Midway to Houston Hobby.  They have to be carrying
PTEXT	enough traffic in the market that they'd benefit from putting on at least a
PTEXT	couple of nonstops.  So why don't they?  (Don't tell me they're afraid
PTEXT	of CO, Kevin, I can't believe that's it(*)).  There are other places where
PTEXT	you figure Southwest would short-circuit onestops with at least one
PTEXT	nonstop.  I don't see what the downside of this would be.

PTEXT	Why does a connection beat a onestop?  A onestop would seem to be better
PTEXT	than a connection---less chance of lost luggage for one thing!  No
PTEXT	running around a terminal, etc.  And WN onestops spend much less time
PTEXT	on the ground than any connection, so you'd figure there is a speed
PTEXT	advantage too.  I've never seen any particular charm in a 40 minute
PTEXT	stay in Memphis airport, lining up to board, all the usual stuff.
