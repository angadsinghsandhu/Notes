DESCRIPTION

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spell checker.

Implement the Trie class:

- `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)`: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- `boolean search(String word)`: Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
- `boolean startsWith(String prefix)`: Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.
