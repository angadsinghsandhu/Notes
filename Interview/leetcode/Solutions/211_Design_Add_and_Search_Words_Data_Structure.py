DESCRIPTION

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

- `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
- `void addWord(String word)`: Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
- `boolean search(String word)`: Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. A `word` may contain dots `.` where dots can be matched with any letter.
