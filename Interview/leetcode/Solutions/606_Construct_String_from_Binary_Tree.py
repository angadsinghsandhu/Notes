DESCRIPTION

Given the `root` node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.
2. Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses.
   - If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
   - If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.
3. Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., `()`) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.

In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.

#### Example 1:

Input:
root = [1,2,3,4]

Output:

"1(2(4))(3)"

Explanation:
Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

#### Example 2:

Input:
root = [1,2,3,null,4]

Output:

"1(2()(4))(3)"

Explanation:
Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.

#### Constraints:

  - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
  - `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`.

class Solution:

    Thought Process:
    - The problem asks for a specific string representation of a binary tree, generated via a preorder traversal.
    - The rules for forming the string are a key part of the problem.
    - We need to handle three cases for each node:
      1. Has no children.
      2. Has only a left child.
      3. Has only a right child.
      4. Has both left and right children.
    - A recursive solution (DFS) based on preorder traversal (Root -> Left -> Right) is a natural fit.
    - The base case is a null node, which should result in an empty string.

    Input:
        root: Optional[TreeNode] - The root of the binary tree.

    Output:
        str - The string representation of the tree.

        """
        Approach: Recursive Preorder Traversal (DFS)
        - The helper function will recursively build the string for each subtree.
        - Base case: if `root` is None, return an empty string.
        - Recursion logic:
          - Start with the current node's value as a string.
          - Recursively get the strings for the left and right subtrees.
          - Apply the rules for parentheses:
            - If there is no left child and no right child, just return the node's value.
            - If there is a left child, wrap its string representation in parentheses and append it.
            - If there is a right child, wrap its string representation in parentheses and append it.
            - The special case: if there's a right child but no left child, we must add an empty `()` for the left child.

        T.C.: O(N) - Each node is visited once. String operations take time proportional to the length of the string, but total length is O(N).
        S.C.: O(H) - Where H is the height of the tree, for the recursion stack.

        Approach: Iterative Preorder Traversal (DFS) with a Stack
        - Use a stack to simulate the preorder traversal.
        - The logic is more complex than the recursive version due to the need to handle parentheses.
        - We can push nodes to a stack and use a `visited` set to know whether to add parentheses.
        - A cleaner iterative approach might use a stack and build the string directly, managing parentheses manually.
        - Let's use a stack to track nodes and a `visited` set to manage the "closing" of subtrees.
