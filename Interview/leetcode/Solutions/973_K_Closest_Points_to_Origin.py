DESCRIPTION

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4

    """
    Thought Process:
    - Calculate the squared distance for each point (avoid sqrt for efficiency).
    - Identify the k smallest distances using various methods: sorting, max-heap, or built-in heap functions.

    Approach:
    - Three methods are provided: sorting, max-heap, and using heapq.nsmallest.
    - All methods leverage the squared distance to avoid computational overhead.

        Space Complexity: O(n) for storing sorted list.
