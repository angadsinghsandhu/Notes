Leetcode Link: <https://leetcode.com/problems/analyze-user-website-visit-pattern/>

DESCRIPTION

You are given the browsing history of multiple users stored in three arrays:  
- `username[i]` represents the user who visited `website[i]` at time `timestamp[i]`.

The goal is to find a **sequence of three websites** that is the most popular among users.

A **pattern** is defined as any three websites visited in **chronological order**, not necessarily distinct.

The **popularity** of a pattern is determined by counting how many **unique users** visited that sequence in order.

Return the **most visited pattern** with the highest score.  
In case of a tie, return the **lexicographically smallest pattern**.

---

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
username = ["joe","joe","joe","jane","jane","jane"]
timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
["home","about","career"]
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
username = ["u1","u1","u1","u2","u2","u2"]
timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
website = ["a","b","a","a","b","c"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
["a","b","c"]
```

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= username.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= username[i].length <= 10`
- `0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= website[i].length <= 10`
- `username[i]` and `website[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- It is guaranteed that at least one user has visited at least three websites.

class Solution:
    """
    Thought Process:
    - We need to analyze users' browsing history and determine the most visited sequence of **three websites**.
    - First, **sort** the data by `timestamp` to ensure visits are in chronological order.
    - Then, **group visits by user**, keeping their visited websites in order.
    - Generate all **unique three-website sequences** per user.
    - Count occurrences of each sequence across all users.
    - Return the **most frequent sequence**, breaking ties **lexicographically**.

    Input:
        username: List[str] - List of usernames.
        timestamp: List[int] - Timestamps corresponding to user visits.
        website: List[str] - Websites visited at corresponding timestamps.

    Output:
        List[str] - The most frequently visited three-website sequence.

        Approach:
        - Sort data by timestamp.
        - Create a **dictionary** mapping each user to their ordered list of visited websites.
        - Generate all unique **three-website sequences** per user.
        - Use a **counter** to track occurrences of each pattern.
        - Sort patterns by **frequency (descending) and lexicographically**.
