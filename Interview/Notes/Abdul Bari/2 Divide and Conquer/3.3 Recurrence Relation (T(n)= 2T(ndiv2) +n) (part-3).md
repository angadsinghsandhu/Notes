# 2.3.3 Recurrence Relation \(T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\) (Part 3)

## Overview

This lecture delves into solving the recurrence relation \(T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\). We explore the steps involved in deriving this relation and methods to solve it, including the tree method and the substitution method. The session aims to elucidate how such recurrence relations represent the time complexity of certain algorithms.

## Recurrence Relation Derivation

- **Initial Setup**: The function \(T(n)\) represents the time complexity where the algorithm divides the problem into two halves (each of size \(\frac{n}{2}\)) and takes linear time \(n\) for additional operations.
- **Expression**: For \(n > 1\), \(T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\). The base case is \(T(1) = 1\), reflecting the smallest unit of work where no further division occurs.

## Solving the Recurrence Relation

### Tree Method

- **Explanation**: The tree method visualizes the recurrence as a tree where each node splits into two child nodes. Each level sums the work done across all nodes at that level, starting with \(n\) at the root.
- **Expansion**:
  - Level 0: \(n\)
  - Level 1: \(2 \times \frac{n}{2} = n\)
  - Level 2: \(4 \times \frac{n}{4} = n\)
  - Continues until the level \(k\), where \(\frac{n}{2^k} = 1\).
- **Conclusion**: The number of levels \(k\) is \(\log(n)\), and since each level contributes \(n\), the total work is \(n \log(n)\).

### Substitution Method

- **Setup**: Start by substituting \(T(n)\) into itself, reducing the problem size by a factor of two with each substitution.
- **Steps**:
  - Initial: \(T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\)
  - First Substitution: Replace \(T(\frac{n}{2})\) with \(2T(\frac{n}{4}) + \frac{n}{2}\) and so forth.
- **General Formulation**: After \(k\) substitutions, express \(T(n)\) in terms of \(n\) and \(k\) where \(k\) is determined by the condition \(\frac{n}{2^k} = 1\).
- **Final Expression**: \(T(n) = n \log(n)\) capturing the dominant term.

## Conclusion

The lecture detailed the process of solving the recurrence relation \(T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\) using different methods, emphasizing the complexity of \(n \log(n)\) for this particular type of recurrence. Understanding these techniques is crucial for analyzing the efficiency of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## Next Steps

- **Master's Theorem**: In the next lecture, we will explore the Master's Theorem, which provides a direct method to solve recurrence relations of this form without extensive manual calculation.
