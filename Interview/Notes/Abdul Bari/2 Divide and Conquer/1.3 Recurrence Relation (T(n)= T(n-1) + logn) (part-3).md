# 2.1.3 Recurrence Relation (T(n) = T(n-1) + log n) (Part 3)

## Overview

In this lecture, we focus on solving the recurrence relation `T(n) = T(n-1) + log n`. Building on the foundation laid in previous videos, we adopt a quicker approach to solving, skipping some intermediate steps for brevity while still demonstrating the critical concepts.

## Algorithm Analysis

### Key Observation

- **Loop Analysis**: Observing a loop where `i` starts from 1 and is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, we recognize that this loop executes `log n` times due to the exponential increase of `i`.

### Recurrence Relation Setup

- **Base Case**: `T(n) = 1` when `n = 0`.
- **Recursive Case**: For `n > 0`, the recurrence relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + log n`.

## Solving with Tree Method

### Process

1. **Tree Construction**: Starting with `T(n)`, each level of the tree represents a call to `T(n-1)`, decrementing `n` by 1 and adding `log n` at each step.
2. **Ending Condition**: The recursion terminates when `n` becomes 0.

### Summation

- **Total Time**: The time for each call accumulates as `log n + log(n-1) + ... + log 1`.
- **Simplification**: This sum can be written as `log(n!)`.

### Time Complexity

- **Upper Bound**: Using Stirling's approximation, `log(n!)` simplifies to `n log n`, giving a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.

## Solving with Induction (Substitution Method)

### Steps

1. **Equation Setup**: Starting with `T(n) = T(n-1) + log n`.
2. **Expansion**: Expand the recurrence relation step by step until `T(n)` is expressed entirely in terms of `T(0)` and a series of logarithmic terms.
3. **Final Expression**: The series of logarithms adds up to `log(n!)`.

### Conclusion

- **Time Complexity**: The repeated application of the recursive formula confirms the time complexity as `O(n log n)`.

## Summary

This lecture consolidates understanding of solving complex recurrence relations through both tree and induction methods. By simplifying the recurrence relation for `T(n) = T(n-1) + log n` to an expression involving factorial logarithms, we derive a practical and theoretical understanding of algorithmic time complexity. These methods highlight the importance of recognizing pattern and behavior in recursive functions to predict their performance efficiently.
