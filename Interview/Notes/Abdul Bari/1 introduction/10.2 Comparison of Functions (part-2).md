# 1.10.2 Comparison of Functions (Part-2)

## Overview

This lecture focuses on comparing the growth rates of various functions using logarithmic transformations and asymptotic notations. Understanding how to determine which function grows faster under different conditions is crucial for algorithm analysis.

## Logarithmic Transformations for Function Comparison

- **Example Analysis**:
  - Comparing `n^(log n)` and `2^(root(10))`, we apply logarithms to both sides, simplifying `n^(log n)` to `(log n) * log n` and `2^(root(10))` to `root(10) * log 2`.
  - After applying logarithmic transformations multiple times, we determine that `log(log n)` is smaller than `log n`.

## Detailed Function Comparisons

### Comparing Specific Functions

- **Function G1 and G2**:
  - Function G1 behaves as `n^3` for `n < 10000` and `n^2` for `n >= 10000`.
  - Function G2 is consistently `n^2`.
  - For `n < 100`, G1 is greater than G2. For `n >= 10000`, G2 is always greater.

### Asymptotic Analysis of Combined Functions

- **Using Coefficients in Logarithmic Comparisons**:
  - When comparing functions using logarithms, coefficients should not be ignored after applying logarithmic transformations. For example, if comparing `2n` with `n`, `2n` is always greater, highlighting the importance of coefficients in function growth rates.

## Practical Examples

### Asymptotic Notations and Binomial Expansion

- **Binomial Expansion**:
  - For `n + 3 whole^2`, the highest term is `n^2`. Similarly, for higher powers like `n^m`, `n^m` dominates.
  - In asymptotic analysis, significant terms that dictate growth rates are emphasized.

### Function Growth Comparison

- **Comparing Exponential Functions**:
  - `2^(2^n)` versus `4^n`, where `4^n` is shown to be a smaller growth rate compared to `2^(2^n)` using asymptotic notations.

## Summary

This lecture provides techniques to compare function growth rates effectively using logarithmic transformations and understanding of asymptotic behaviors. The session elaborates on how to handle coefficients in logarithmic comparisons and the importance of considering dominant terms in function analysis. The examples discussed serve as practical applications commonly encountered in competitive exams and algorithm design.
