# Introduction to Algorithms - Class 1

## Overview

This class is an introductory lecture on algorithms, focusing on simplifying the subject for students who often find some topics difficult to grasp. The lecture is designed to help students understand and remember the concepts easily. Algorithms are crucial for both theoretical examinations and practical applications like competitive programming and job interviews.

## Importance of Algorithms

- Algorithms are a core subject in computer science engineering.
- They are significant in both academic and competitive environments.
- Understanding algorithms is essential for developing logical and strategic problem-solving skills.

## Definition and Comparison of Algorithm and Program

- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem, used primarily during the design phase of software development.
- **Program**: The actual coded implementation of algorithms, written during the implementation phase.

### Differences between Algorithm and Program
