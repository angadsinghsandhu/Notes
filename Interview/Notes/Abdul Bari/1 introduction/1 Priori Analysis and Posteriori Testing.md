# 1.1 Priori Analysis and Posteriori Testing

## Overview

This lecture discusses two fundamental concepts in algorithm and program development: **Priori Analysis** and **Posteriori Testing**. These terms describe the evaluation methods used for algorithms and programs, respectively.

## Definitions

### Priori Analysis

- **Definition**: Analysis of an algorithm by studying it theoretically before it is implemented.
- **Purpose**: To determine the theoretical performance of an algorithm in terms of time and space usage without actually executing it.

### Posteriori Testing

- **Definition**: Testing a program by executing it to observe its actual performance.
- **Purpose**: To measure the actual runtime and memory usage of a program during its execution.

| **Dependency**  | Independent of programming language and hardware specifications. | Dependent on specific programming languages and hardware setups.   |
| **Metrics**     | Theoretical functions describing time and space complexity.       | Actual runtime measurements (e.g., seconds, milliseconds) and memory usage (e.g., bytes).                                        |

## Summary

- **Priori Analysis** provides a theoretical and language-independent evaluation of an algorithm's efficiency.
- **Posteriori Testing** gives empirical, concrete performance data for a program under specific system conditions.

This lecture emphasizes the distinction between analyzing an algorithm's design and testing a program's execution, highlighting the different focus areas and methodologies associated with each approach.
