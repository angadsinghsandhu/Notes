# 1.11 Best, Worst, and Average Case Analysis

## Overview

In this lecture, we discuss the best, worst, and average case analyses of algorithms, focusing on two common algorithms: linear search and binary search tree. Understanding these analyses is crucial for predicting algorithm performance under various conditions.

## Linear Search Analysis

### Introduction to Linear Search Analysis

Linear search involves scanning a list sequentially to find a target element. It is one of the simplest search algorithms and provides a clear example of best, worst, and average case scenarios.

### Best Case Scenario - Linear Search

- **Definition**: The best case occurs when the target element is found at the first position in the list.
- **Time Complexity**: The best case time complexity is constant, `O(1)`, since only one comparison is needed.

### Worst Case Scenario - Linear Search

- **Definition**: The worst case happens when the target is not in the list or is at the last position.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity in the worst case is linear, `O(n)`, involving `n` comparisons.

### Average Case Scenario - Linear Search

- **Analysis**: Average case considers all possible positions of the target element, averaging the number of comparisons.
- **Time Complexity**: The average case time complexity can be expressed as `O(n)`, similar to the worst case, with a specific calculation showing `(n + 1) / 2` comparisons on average.

## Binary Search Tree (BST) Analysis

### Introduction to BST Analysis

A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure where each node has elements smaller than the current node to the left, and elements larger to the right, facilitating efficient searching.

### Best Case Scenario - BST

- **Definition**: The best case occurs when the target element is the root of the tree.
- **Time Complexity**: Since only one comparison is needed if the target is the root, the best case time complexity is `O(1)`.

### Worst Case Scenario - BST

- **Definition**: The worst case happens when the target element is located at the deepest leaf of the tree.
- **Variable Time Complexity**:
  - **Balanced BST**: The height of the tree approximates `log(n)`, leading to a worst case time complexity of `O(log n)`.
  - **Unbalanced BST (e.g., skewed tree)**: The height could be as much as `n` (linear), resulting in a worst case time complexity of `O(n)`.

### Average Case Scenario - BST

- **Analysis**: The average case in a BST depends on the tree's structure but often closely aligns with the worst case.
- **Time Complexity**: Typically approximated as `O(log n)` in balanced trees, reflecting the tree's height.

## Asymptotic Notations

- **Notations Applicability**: Notations like Big O, Omega (Ω), and Theta (Θ) are used to classify the time complexities regardless of whether it's a best, worst, or average case scenario.
- **Examples**:
  - Best case can be expressed using any notation: `O(1)`, `Ω(1)`, or `Θ(1)`.
  - Worst case for linear search can be expressed as `O(n)`, `Ω(n)`, or `Θ(n)`.
  - For a binary search tree, depending on the tree's structure, worst case scenarios range from `O(log n)` to `O(n)`.

## Summary

This lecture covered the essential concepts of best, worst, and average case analyses in algorithms, demonstrating with linear search and binary search trees. We explored how these cases affect performance predictions and how asymptotic notations are used to describe these scenarios comprehensively.
