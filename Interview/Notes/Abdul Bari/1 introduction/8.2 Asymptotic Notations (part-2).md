# 1.8.2 Asymptotic Notations: Big O, Omega, Theta (part-1)

## Overview

Continuing our exploration of asymptotic notations, this lecture further delves into the practical application of Big O, Omega, and Theta notations through examples. These notations help in understanding and expressing the growth limits of functions, which in turn describe the time complexity of algorithms.

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Quadratic Function

- **Function**: \( f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 4 \)
- **Big O**: \( f(n) = O(n^2) \)
  - **Explanation**: As \( n \) becomes large, \( 2n^2 \) dominates the function, and we can bound it above by \( 9n^2 \) for simplicity.
- **Omega**: \( f(n) = \Omega(n^2) \)
  - **Explanation**: Similarly, \( f(n) \) grows at least as fast as \( n^2 \), thus it also has a lower bound of \( n^2 \).
- **Theta**: \( f(n) = \Theta(n^2) \)
  - **Explanation**: Since \( f(n) \) is bounded by \( n^2 \) both above and below, it is tightly bound by \( n^2 \), indicating a precise asymptotic behavior.

### Example 2: Mixed Polynomial-Logarithmic Function

- **Function**: \( f(n) = n^2 \log n + n \)
- **Big O**: \( f(n) = O(n^2 \log n) \)
  - **Explanation**: The term \( n^2 \log n \) grows faster than \( n \), thus dominating the function, and can be approximated closely by \( 10n^2 \log n \).
- **Omega**: \( f(n) = \Omega(n^2 \log n) \)
- **Theta**: \( f(n) = \Theta(n^2 \log n) \)
  - **Explanation**: As the function is tightly sandwiched between bounds that grow as \( n^2 \log n \), it holds a tight asymptotic bound of \( n^2 \log n \).

### Example 3: Factorial Function

- **Function**: \( f(n) = n! \)
- **Big O**: \( f(n) = O(n^n) \)
  - **Explanation**: The factorial function grows extremely rapidly, such that \( n^n \) can serve as an upper asymptotic bound.
- **Omega**: \( f(n) = \Omega(1) \)
  - **Explanation**: The factorial function grows faster than any polynomial, but the smallest value it can have is 1 (at \( n = 0 \)).
- **Theta**: Not applicable for \( n! \)
  - **Explanation**: Due to the super-exponential growth of the factorial function, it does not have a tight bound that grows at the same rate both above and below.

## Implications for Algorithm Analysis

These examples illustrate the power of asymptotic notations in characterizing the growth behavior of complex functions, which in turn helps in estimating the performance limits of algorithms. Correctly applying these notations ensures that:

- **Big O** provides an assurance of an upper limit on time complexity.
- **Omega** offers a guarantee of a minimum time complexity.
- **Theta** gives a precise measure of the expected time complexity.

## Conclusion

Understanding and correctly applying asymptotic notations is crucial in the analysis of algorithms. These notations simplify the task of comparing algorithms and understanding their behavior under large input sizes. Through the examples discussed, we see how each notation serves a specific purpose, helping in providing a comprehensive view of an algorithm's performance.
