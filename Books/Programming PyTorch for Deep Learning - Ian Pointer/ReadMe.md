# Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning - Ian Pointer

This book is a practical guide to mastering deep learning using Facebook's open-source PyTorch framework. It covers key ideas and concepts of deep learning and neural networks. The author, Ian Pointer, walks you through the creation of neural architectures that facilitate operations on images, sound, text, and more. The book also covers the critical concepts of applying transfer learning to images, debugging models, and PyTorch in production. You will learn how to deploy deep learning models to production and explore PyTorch use cases from several leading companies. The book also covers how to apply cutting-edge NLP techniques using a model trained on Wikipedia and how to use PyTorch's torchaudio library to classify audio data with a convolutional-based model. Finally, the book covers how to debug PyTorch models using TensorBoard and flame-graphs and deploy PyTorch applications in production in Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters running on Google Cloud.
