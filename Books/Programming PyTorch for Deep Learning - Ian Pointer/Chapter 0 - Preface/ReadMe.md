# Preface

This book is an introduction to deep learning via PyTorch, an open-source library released by Facebook in 2017. The book discusses the history of neural networks and deep learning and how they have become ubiquitous in our daily lives.

The book also covers the surge in graphical processing units (GPUs) performance and their increasing affordability, which has been a prime reason for the explosion of deep learning in the last 10 years.

GPUs are designed originally for gaming and need to perform countless millions of matrix operations per second in order to render all the polygons for the driving or shooting game you’re playing on your console or PC, operations that a standard CPU just isn’t optimized for.

***Deep Learning***: is a machine learning technique that uses multiple and numerous layers of nonlinear transforms to progressively extract features from raw input.
