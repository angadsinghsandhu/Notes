## Lecture 10 : Earley's Algorithm

Features of Earley's Algorithm:

- It is able to work with either left recursive or right recursive grammar that other parsers (recursive descent and bottom up parsers) have a hard time dealing with.
- It works with ambigious grammar (multiple parses)
- Allows for good error reporting.

Disadvantages of Earley's Algorithm:

- it's not efficient O(n^3) for ambigious grammar O(n^2) oherwise. while alternatives are O(n) in best case.
