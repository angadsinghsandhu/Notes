DESCRIPTION

Given `n` wines in a row, with integers denoting the cost of each wine respectively. Each year you can sell the first or the last wine in the row. Let the initial profits from the wines be P1, P2, P3â€¦Pn. In the Yth year, the profit from the ith wine will be Y * P[i]. The goal is to calculate the maximum profit that can be earned by selling all the wines.

---

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
wines = [2, 4, 6, 2, 5]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
64
```

**Explanation:**  
The maximum profit can be achieved by selling the wines in the following order:
- Year 1: Sell wine at index 0 (price = 2 * 1 = 2)
- Year 2: Sell wine at index 4 (price = 5 * 2 = 10)
- Year 3: Sell wine at index 3 (price = 2 * 3 = 6)
- Year 4: Sell wine at index 1 (price = 4 * 4 = 16)
- Year 5: Sell wine at index 2 (price = 6 * 5 = 30)
Total profit = 2 + 10 + 6 + 16 + 30 = 64

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= P[i] <= 1000`

    Thought Process:
    - The problem involves maximizing profit by selling wines from either end over multiple years.
    - A brute-force approach involves checking all possible sequences of selling wines, but this is inefficient.
    - An optimized approach uses dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

    Input:
        wines: List[int] - A list of wine prices.

    Output:
        int - The maximum profit achievable.
