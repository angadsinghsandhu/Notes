# Description:
#   Implements a strategy for choosing the best locker for an item.
#   The strategy considers the productâ€™s recommended locker type as well as
#   the distance of available lockers from the system.
#
# SOLID:
# - OCP: New strategies can be added by implementing the StorageStrategy interface.
# - DIP: High-level modules depend on this abstraction.
