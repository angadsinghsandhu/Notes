Beumer Group is a German logistics systems manufacturer operating in over **70** countries with **5,500** employees and **$1.8 billion** in revenue. Specializing in automated logistics, the company needed to streamline its warehouse operations to handle the growing logistics demands globally. This required replacing outdated manual processes with modern digital solutions.

### **Task**  
During my first year of college, I secured an internship as a Full Stack Web Development Intern at Beumer Group. I was tasked with developing a basic Visitor Management System (VMS) to digitize the tracking of more than 150 warehouse visitors per day across the country, which was earlier done manually. Initially, I struggled to meet my manager’s expectations because of a lack of proper communication about the project’s scope and requirements.

### **Action**  
Recognizing the communication gap, I proactively arranged one-on-one meetings with my manager to request clear requirements and a better understanding of expectations. After satisfying the basic requirements, I then expanded the basic project scope by integrating additional functionalities. I implemented a multi-tier authorization system with three roles (Visitor, Employee, and Manager) and rebuilt the manual log system using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) along with techniques such as lazy loading. This approach increased operational efficiency, reduced errors, and improved system accessibility. I also implemented real-time alerts for managers when visitors failed to check out, which enhanced security.

### **Result**  
By applying lazy loading techniques, I enhanced the system speed by **35%**, ensuring fast data retrieval even during high traffic. The improved system achieved a **100% reduction** in unauthorized warehouse access incidents after deployment. This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication and assertiveness, which are skills that have been instrumental in my subsequent projects.

## **2. Untitled Startup (2021) – Peer Networking App**

### **Situation**  
In 2021, I co-founded a college project with five of the best computer science undergraduates from my college, each specializing in different areas such as backend development, UI/UX design, and database management. During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote learning limited students’ ability to connect with their peers, and form bonds with each other, which is especially important in the first few years of college. There was a clear need for a platform to bridge this gap for over 10,000 potential new students to connect every year in my university.

### **Task**  
Our mission was to develop a platform that connected students based on academic and personal interests. Despite assembling a talented team, we encountered challenges in executive decision-making. The differing approaches, lack of unanimity, and schedules of team members led to frequent misalignments in goals, and after six months, we had only a mock frontend and a functioning backend. The unresolved conflicts in vision and work distribution hindered progress and ultimately affected the project’s success.

### **Action**  
I recognized that my failure to lead assertively was a key factor in our decision-making delays. I made a conscious effort to shift from a consensus-driven approach to decisive leadership. I engaged with industry professionals to gain insights into effective idea execution. Additionally, I personally worked on improving the application’s features, such as the messaging system, by immersing myself in hands-on development and iterating rapidly on the design.

### **Result**  
Through this experience, I designed and implemented a WebSocket-based communication system that allowed real-time messaging even for large group-chats of up to **1,048 users per group**, with a lag time of **<1 second** in user testing phases. Although the project ultimately failed due to time constraints following the pandemic, I emerged with invaluable leadership experience. I learned the importance of decisiveness and having a backbone rather than simply seeking to please everyone. This experience helped me develop the ability to manage future teams effectively, and later on I was able to leverage the backend system in my **final project** in 2023.

This, however, means that I often have a hard time letting work go and delegating tasks to team members to speed up the process. To remedy this, I have started to communicate my project goals and have taken the time to train and collaborate with members to handle tasks in an efficient manner. This way, everyone in the team functions cohesively and I am assured of the standard of work being presented. An example of this would be at **Beumer group**, where I guided my fellow teammates through utilizing the MEAN stack, and was able to delegate some frontend development tasks. The project panned out very well, utlimately.

However, it slowed me down and this was was not efficient or constructive in a fast-paced, result-focused research environment where papers were waiting on the results of my work. Therefore, I hand-picked and trained one junior researcher on my tasks and methods to ensure the same standards of work while doubling my efficiency.

For example, [] -->
