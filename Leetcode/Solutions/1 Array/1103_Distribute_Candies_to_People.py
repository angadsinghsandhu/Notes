DESCRIPTION

We distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the following way:
We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give n candies to the last person.
Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person.
This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.
The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).
Return an array (of length num_people and sum candies) that represents the final distribution of candies.

---

#### Example 1:

Input:
candies = 7, num_people = 4

Output:
[1,2,3,1]

Explanation:
On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0,0].
On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0,0].
On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3,0].
On the fourth turn, ans[3] += 1 (because there is only one candy left), and the final array is [1,2,3,1].

---

#### Example 2:

Input:
candies = 10, num_people = 3

Output:
[5,2,3]

Explanation:
On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0].
On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0].
On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3].
On the fourth turn, ans[0] += 4, and the final array is [5,2,3].

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= candies <= 10^9
- 1 <= num_people <= 1000

    Thought Process for Distribute Candies to People:

    The problem describes a distribution process where candies are given out in increasing amounts
    (1, 2, 3, ...). The distribution cycles through the people. The last person gets any remaining candies.

    The most straightforward approach is to simulate the process directly, as described.

    1.  **Direct Simulation:**
        -   **Idea:** Follow the rules step-by-step. Maintain an array to store candies for each person, a counter for the current candy amount to give, and the remaining total candies.
        -   **Algorithm:**
            1.  Initialize `ans = [0] * num_people`. This array will store the total candies each person receives.
            2.  Initialize `current_gift = 1`. This is the amount of candy to give in the current turn.
            3.  Initialize `person_idx = 0`. This is the 0-indexed person currently receiving candies.
            4.  Start a loop that continues as long as `candies > 0`:
                a.  Determine the actual amount to give in this turn: `amount_to_give = min(current_gift, candies)`. We use `min` because the last person might not receive the full `current_gift` amount if `candies` run out.
                b.  Add `amount_to_give` to the current person's total: `ans[person_idx] += amount_to_give`.
                c.  Subtract the given amount from the total `candies`: `candies -= amount_to_give`.
                d.  Increment `current_gift` for the next turn: `current_gift += 1`.
                e.  Move to the next person in a circular manner: `person_idx = (person_idx + 1) % num_people`.
            5.  Once `candies` become 0 or less, the loop terminates. Return `ans`.

        -   **Time Complexity (T.C.):** O(sqrt(candies)).
            -   In each step of the loop, `current_gift` increases by 1. The total number of candies given out after `k` turns is $1 + 2 + ... + k = k * (k + 1) / 2$.
            -   If `candies` is `C`, then $k * (k + 1) / 2 \approx C \implies k^2 / 2 \approx C \implies k \approx \sqrt{2C}$.
            -   Given `candies <= 10^9`, `k` would be roughly `sqrt(2 * 10^9) = sqrt(2000 * 10^6) approx 44721`.
            -   A loop running ~45,000 times is perfectly acceptable for typical time limits (usually 10^7-10^8 operations per second).
        -   **Space Complexity (S.C.):** O(num_people). This is for the `ans` array, which needs to store a value for each person. Given `num_people <= 1000`, this is a very small memory footprint.

    2.  **Mathematical Optimization (More Complex):**
        -   **Idea:** This approach tries to calculate the number of full rounds and the candies distributed in those rounds mathematically, then simulate only the final partial round.
        -   **Steps:**
            1.  Find `k_total`, the total number of gifts that would be given if all `candies` were distributed in increments (i.e., solve $k(k+1)/2 \ge \text{candies}$). This `k_total` can be found using binary search or the quadratic formula.
            2.  Calculate `num_rounds = k_total // num_people`.
            3.  Calculate `remaining_gifts = k_total % num_people`.
            4.  For each person `j` (0-indexed):
                -   Calculate candies from full rounds: This is an arithmetic series sum.
                    For person `j`, gifts are `j+1`, `j+1+num_people`, `j+1+2*num_people`, ..., `j+1 + (num_rounds-1)*num_people`.
                    The sum of such a series can be computed efficiently.
            5.  Distribute the candies for the `remaining_gifts` in the last partial round starting from `num_rounds * num_people + 1`.
        -   **T.C.:** O(log(candies)) for finding `k_total` + O(num_people) for summing arithmetic series and final partial round. Overall O(num_people + log(candies)).
        -   **S.C.:** O(num_people).
        -   **Consideration:** While theoretically more efficient in terms of `candies`, the increased complexity of implementation (especially handling sums of arithmetic series) often makes the direct simulation preferable for "Easy" or "Medium" problems unless `sqrt(candies)` is too large to pass. Given `candies <= 10^9`, `sqrt(candies)` is perfectly fine.
