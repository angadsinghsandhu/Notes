# Dynamic Programming

## Collection of overlaping sub-problems

**Factors affecting DP**
- 1. Overlapping sub-problems
- 2. Memorization   [1-D Array]
- 3. Tabulation     [2-D Array]

### </ins> **Memorization** </ins>
Here we have the computed values of sub-problems in an Array 
till n-1 sub problem and use that to calculate nth sub-problem.

Problems that use this : Fibonacci numbers, Longest Common Subsequence,


### </ins> **Tabulation** </ins>
Here we have the computed values of sub-problems in a Matrix 
till (n x n-1) sub problem and use that to calculate (n x n)th sub-problem.
