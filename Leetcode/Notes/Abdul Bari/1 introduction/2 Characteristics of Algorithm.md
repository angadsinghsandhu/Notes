# 1.2 Characteristics of Algorithm

## Overview

This lecture discusses the essential characteristics of algorithms, drawing analogies with functions in programming and procedures in various fields like chemistry and cooking.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm

### Input and Output

- **Input**: Algorithms may take zero or more inputs. An algorithm that doesn't require an input is still valid.
- **Output**: Every algorithm must generate at least one output to justify its existence. This is similar to how functions in programming may not take parameters but still produce a result.

### Definiteness

- **Definition**: Each statement in an algorithm must be unambiguous and clear, having a single, exact meaning. Ambiguous or unsolvable statements are not acceptable as they cannot be processed by a computer.

### Finiteness

- **Definition**: An algorithm must have a finite number of steps, and it must terminate. Even if an algorithm includes thousands of statements, it should not run indefinitely like some continuous services (e.g., a database server).

### Effectiveness

- **Definition**: Every statement in an algorithm should serve a specific purpose. Unnecessary statements that do not contribute to the algorithm's objective should be avoided.

## Analogies to Other Procedures

The speaker likens the structure and requirements of an algorithm to that of procedures in chemistry and cooking:

- **Chemical Experiments**: Just as a chemical experiment needs specific chemicals and apparatus and aims to produce a particular chemical reaction or product, an algorithm needs input and aims to achieve a computational result.
- **Cooking Recipes**: Similarly, cooking involves following specific steps (recipe) to produce a dish. This process requires particular ingredients (inputs) and results in a finished dish (output).

## Summary

Algorithms, much like procedures in scientific experiments or recipes in cooking, require inputs and produce outputs. They must be defined with clear and unambiguous instructions, ensure all processes are finite and terminate, and maintain effectiveness by avoiding unnecessary steps.
