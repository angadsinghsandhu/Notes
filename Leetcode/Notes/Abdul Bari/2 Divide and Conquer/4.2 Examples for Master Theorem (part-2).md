# 2.4.2 Examples for Master Theorem (Part-2)

## Overview

This lecture delves into various examples of the Master Theorem, focusing on solving recurrence relations by categorizing them into different cases. This session covers Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, showcasing how to apply the Master Theorem to derive time complexities.

## Case 1: Simple Examples

### Examples for Case 1

1. **T(n) = 2T(n/2) + 1**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 2 is 1, and f(n) = 1 (n^0). Since log_2(2) = n^0, the complexity is Theta(n).

2. **T(n) = 4T(n/2) + 1**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 4 is 2. As f(n) = 1 (n^0) is less, the complexity is Theta(n^2).

3. **T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 4 is 2, but since n^1 is the term, the complexity is Theta(n^2).

4. **T(n) = 8T(n/2) + n^2**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 8 is 3, and f(n) = n^2, leading to a complexity of Theta(n^3).

5. **T(n) = 16T(n/2) + n^2**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 16 is 4, with f(n) being n^2, leading to a complexity of Theta(n^4).

## Case 2: Logarithmic Multipliers

### Examples for Case 2

1. **T(n) = T(n/2) + 1**:
   - **Analysis**: Both log base 2 of 1 and n^0 are zero, so the complexity is Theta(log n).

2. **T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n**:
   - **Analysis**: Since n matches the log base, and with additional logarithmic multiplication, the complexity is Theta(n log n).

3. **T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n log n**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 2 is 1, matching n^1, thus the complexity is Theta(n log^2 n).

4. **T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 4 is 2, matching n^2, leading to a complexity of Theta(n^2 log n).

## Case 3: Complex Functions

### Examples for Case 3

1. **T(n) = T(n/2) + n**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 1 is 0. Since n is greater, the complexity is Theta(n).

2. **T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n^2**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 2 is 1, but n^2 dominates, so the complexity is Theta(n^2).

3. **T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^3 log^2(n)**:
   - **Analysis**: Log base 2 of 4 is 2. n^3 is the term, thus complexity is Theta(n^3 log^2(n)).

4. **T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n^2 / log(n)**:
   - **Analysis**: Although the term involves log(n) in the denominator, n^2 dominates, making the complexity Theta(n^2).

## Summary

This lecture provided a comprehensive set of examples illustrating the application of the Master Theorem across various cases. Understanding how to categorize and solve recurrence relations using the Master Theorem is crucial for algorithm complexity analysis, enhancing both theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving skills.
