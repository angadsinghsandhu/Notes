# 2.1.4 Recurrence Relation (T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1) (Part 4)

## Overview

In this lecture, we explore the recurrence relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1`, commonly found in algorithms that exhibit recursive behavior. This session will provide a brief explanation, mainly focusing on solving the recurrence using different methods. For a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the approach, refer to earlier sessions, which are numerically indexed beside the video.

## Recurrence Relation Definition

- **Equation**: `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1`
- **Initial Condition**: When `n = 0`, `T(n)` is a constant, typically `T(0) = 1`.

## Methods for Solving the Recurrence

### Recursion Tree Method

1. **Expansion**:
   - The function calls itself twice for each non-base case (i.e., for `n > 0`), increasing the recursive depth.
   - At each level, the function call expands into two subsequent calls with the decremented value of `n`.
2. **Time Complexity Analysis**:
   - At each level `i`, the number of calls is `2^i`, each contributing a unit time.
   - The total time at level `i` is `2^i`.
   - The time complexity for the entire recursion tree sums up to the geometric series: `1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^k`.

3. **Geometric Series Result**:
   - The sum for the geometric series is `2^(k+1) - 1`.
   - Using the recursion depth relation `n = k`, the total time complexity is `O(2^n)`.

### Back Substitution Method

1. **Iterative Expansion**:
   - Begin with the original relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1`.
   - Substitute iteratively to express `T(n)` in terms of `T(n-2)`, `T(n-3)`, etc., until `T(n-k)`.

2. **General Formulation**:
   - After `k` substitutions, the relation becomes `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1)`.

3. **Base Case Substitution**:
   - Assuming `n-k = 0`, plug in the base case to get `T(n) = 2^n * T(0) + (2^n - 1)` where `T(0) = 1`.

4. **Simplified Complexity**:
   - This simplifies to `T(n) = 2^(n+1) - 1`, reaffirming that the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.

## Summary

This lecture session demonstrated two powerful methods to solve the recurrence relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1`. Both the recursion tree and back substitution methods point to an exponential time complexity of `O(2^n)`, characteristic of this type of recursive algorithm. These insights are pivotal for understanding the performance implications of such recursive functions in computer algorithms.
