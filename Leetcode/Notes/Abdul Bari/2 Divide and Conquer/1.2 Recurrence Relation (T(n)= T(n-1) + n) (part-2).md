# 2.1.2 Recurrence Relation \( T(n) = T(n-1) + n \) (Part-2)

## Overview

In this continuation of our series on recurrence relations, we explore the specific type of recurrence relation characterized by a decreasing function. This video builds on previous discussions, focusing on a particular recursive function and its implications for algorithmic time complexity.

## Defining the Recurrence Relation

### Function Description

- The function recursively calls itself with the argument \( n-1 \), and within this recursive call, a loop executes \( n \) times.
- **Recurrence Relation Formulation**:
  - Initial loop execution takes \( n \) time units, and the recursive call executes in \( T(n-1) \) time.
  - Combining these, the recurrence relation is initially expressed as \( T(n) = T(n-1) + 2n + 2 \).

### Simplification for Analysis

- For analytical simplicity, the relation is rounded to a more manageable form:
  - \( T(n) = T(n-1) + n \), omitting the constant and linear coefficients for clarity.

## Base Case and Recursive Case

- **Base Case**: When \( n = 0 \), the function does nothing, hence \( T(0) = 1 \) or a similar constant.
- **Recursive Case**: For \( n > 0 \), the recurrence follows \( T(n) = T(n-1) + n \).

## Analytical Techniques

### Recursive Tree Method

- Tracing the recursion shows the function's expansion as it calls itself down to the base case.
- Each level adds the current \( n \) to the total, leading to a summation of all integers from 1 to \( n \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
- Thus, the total time complexity derived from this method is \( T(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), indicating \( \Theta(n^2) \) complexity.

### Back Substitution Method

- This method involves substituting the recurrence relation into itself iteratively.
- It simplifies to \( T(n) = T(n-k) + \text{sum of the series from } (n-k+1) \text{ to } n \).
- After substituting down to \( T(0) \), the sum of the series confirms the quadratic nature of the complexity.

## Conclusion

This lecture deepened the understanding of how to derive and solve a recurrence relation for a given algorithm, using both recursive tree and back substitution methods. The demonstration highlighted that regardless of the method, the computational complexity of the recursive function \( T(n) = T(n-1) + n \) is \( \Theta(n^2) \), reinforcing the importance of recognizing patterns in recursion for efficient algorithm design.

## Future Learning

- Further videos will explore alternative methods like induction and provide shortcuts for solving recurrence relations, useful for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in examinations.
