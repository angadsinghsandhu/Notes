# 2.3.2 Recurrence Relation (T(n) = T(n/2) + n) (Part-2)

## Overview

This lecture explores solving the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + n using two distinct methods: the recursion tree method and the substitution method. These methods help in deriving the time complexity of algorithms, particularly those that divide problems into smaller subproblems of equal size.

## Recursion Tree Method

### Process

- Begin with T(n).
- At each level, the problem is divided into a subproblem of size n/2, and a cost of n is incurred.
- This division continues until the subproblem size reduces to 1 (i.e., n/2^k = 1).

### Calculation

- The costs at each level form a series: n, n/2, n/4, ..., n/2^k.
- Summing these costs gives: n(1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/2^k).
- As k approaches infinity, the sum converges to 2n, due to the properties of a geometric series.

### Conclusion - Recursion Tree Method

- The total cost T(n) is found by summing up the costs across all levels of the tree.
- This gives T(n) = 2n, which simplifies to T(n) = O(n) or Î˜(n).

## Substitution Method

### Explanation

- Start with T(n) = T(n/2) + n.
- Substitute recursively to express T(n) in terms of smaller subproblems: T(n/2), T(n/4), ..., T(n/2^k).

### Steps

- First step: T(n) = T(n/2) + n.
- Second step: T(n) = T(n/4) + n/2 + n.
- Continue substituting until T(n/2^k) where k is such that n/2^k = 1.

### Analysis

- The recurrence results in a similar series as observed in the recursion tree method: n + n/2 + n/4 + ... + 1.
- Summing this series gives a total cost that converges to 2n, confirming the complexity as O(n).

### Conclusion - Substitution Method

- Both methods demonstrate that the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n resolves to a linear complexity of O(n).
- This analysis is crucial for understanding how divide-and-conquer algorithms scale with increasing input size.

## Summary

This lecture provides a comprehensive analysis of the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + n using both the recursion tree and substitution methods. Understanding these methods is essential for accurately determining the time complexity of algorithms that follow this pattern of recursion, which is common in divide-and-conquer strategies.
