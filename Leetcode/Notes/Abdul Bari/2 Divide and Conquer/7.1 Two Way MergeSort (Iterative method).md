# 2.7.1 Two-Way MergeSort (Iterative Method)

## Overview

This lecture discusses the iterative approach to implementing the Two-Way MergeSort algorithm. This sorting method involves merging two sorted lists at a time into a single sorted list. We start by understanding the basic concept of merging before delving into the specifics of the algorithm.

## Understanding Merging

- **Definition**: Merging is the process of combining two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
- **Procedure**:
  - Use index pointers for each list (`i` for list `A`, `j` for list `B`, and `k` for the merged list `C`).
  - Compare elements at `A[i]` and `B[j]`.
  - Copy the smaller element to `C[k]` and advance the corresponding index (`i` or `j`) and `k`.
  - Continue this process until all elements from one list are exhausted.
  - Copy any remaining elements from the other list directly to `C`.

## Algorithm Details

- **Initialization**: Start with index pointers at the beginning of each list.
- **Merging Process**:
  - While both lists have unexamined elements, compare the current elements and copy the smaller one to the result list.
  - If one list is exhausted, append all remaining elements from the other list to the result list.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of merging two lists of sizes `m` and `n` is `Θ(m + n)`.

## Two-Way MergeSort Implementation

- **Concept**: Treat each element in the array as a separate sorted list.
- **First Pass**:
  - Pair up adjacent "lists" (elements) and merge each pair to form a new list of double the size.
  - Repeat the process, merging the newly formed lists until only one sorted list remains.
- **Iterative Process**:
  - Each pass reduces the number of lists by approximately half, and the number of passes required to sort the list completely is `log n` (base 2), where `n` is the total number of elements.

## Example Walkthrough

- **Initial List**: `[3, 9, 5, 7, 4, 6, 2, 8]`
- **Pass 1**:
  - Merge `[3, 9]`, `[5, 7]`, `[4, 6]`, `[2, 8]` to form `[3, 9], [5, 7], [4, 6], [2, 8]`.
- **Pass 2**:
  - Merge `[3, 9]` with `[5, 7]` and `[4, 6]` with `[2, 8]` to form `[3, 5, 7, 9]` and `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- **Final Pass**:
  - Merge `[3, 5, 7, 9]` with `[2, 4, 6, 8]` to form the sorted list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

## Analysis

- **Efficiency**: The iterative Two-Way MergeSort is efficient for sorting large datasets as it systematically reduces the sorting problem by half each time.
- **Complexity**: The total time complexity is `Θ(n log n)`, derived from `n` comparisons per pass and `log n` passes.

## Summary

This lecture provided a detailed examination of the Two-Way MergeSort algorithm using an iterative method. Understanding the merging process is crucial as it is the core operation that ensures the lists remain sorted. The iterative approach, while straightforward, emphasizes the importance of structured methodology in achieving efficient sorting.
