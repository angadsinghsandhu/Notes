# React State

State management is a core concept in React that allows components to keep track of information between renders. In this section, we will explore how to manage state effectively using `useState`, updating state correctly, and handling complex state objects.

We will reinforce these concepts by working on the **Chef Claude Project**, where we will build interactive features such as forms, event listeners, and conditional rendering.
