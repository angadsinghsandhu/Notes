## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
